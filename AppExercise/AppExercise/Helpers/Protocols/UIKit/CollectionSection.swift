/// A concrete type that conforms to CollectionSection protocol.
///
/// Example usage of this is when you want to maintain groups of data models which will later
/// be displayed on a `UITableView`/`CollectionView` instance. You may want to use this
/// as the Element type of your `ControllerViewModel.sections` Array property.
///
/// We suggest that you specialize this type so you won't have to keep specifying the ItemType. For example:
///
///     class SettingsCollectionSection: GenericCollectionSection<SettingsCellViewModel> {}
///
open class GenericCollectionSection<T>: CollectionSection {
  public typealias ItemType = T
  open var items: [T] = []

  open var headerTitle: String?
  open var footerTitle: String?

  public init() {}
