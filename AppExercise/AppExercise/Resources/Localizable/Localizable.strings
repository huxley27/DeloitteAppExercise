/**
 Rules for keys:
 
 1. Use namespace where appropriate.
 e.g. `home.labels.welcome = "Welcome!";`

 2. Use hyphens to concatenate words in phrases. Underscores are discouraged since we're using R.swift.
 e.g. `login-form.labels.first-name = "First name:";`

 The R.swift generated method name: `loginFormLabelsFirstName`

 3. Use dots to separate namespaces and the proper key.

 4. For a word that can be used in any context, just use itself as the key. No need for namespacing.
